<!-- TODO: After publishing the post, create a Discuss page, and link to it. -->

The Dune team has started planning the next major release and we would like to
share and discuss the current plan with the community. We expect to release
Dune 3 in August 2021.

As with previous major releases, we put a lot of effort in backward
compatibility. The majority of Dune users should not notice any breaking changes
unless they explicitly opt into the new behaviour by increasing the version of
the Dune language to 3.0 in a `dune-project` file. However, some of the changes
that we plan to make are not specific to the way Dune deals with individual
projects, and so they can't be guarded by the version specified in a
`dune-project` file. All such changes are listed in the following two sections.

## What's new

Here are the main features we plan include in Dune 3:

* **Incremental file-watching mode.** Dune already supports a basic
  file-watching mode, activated by the `-w` flag, where the build is restarted
  whenever any source file changes. The current implementation is
  non-incremental: restarting really means restarting the build from scratch,
  which, for example, involves reparsing all `dune` files. On small-size
  projects, this is fast enough, but this clearly doesn't scale well to large
  monorepos. We are making the file-watching mode fully incremental, to avoid
  redoing the computations whose inputs didn't change since the previous build.

* **Dune RPC.** We are working on adding an RPC server to Dune that will make it
  possible to control Dune programmatically (instead of using the command line),
  which is often desirable for integration with various other tools, such as
  editors.

* **Better scoping semantics.** Dune provides some project-level scoping
  functionality, for example, it's possible to mark a library as private to
  prevent leaking the implementation details outside of a project. The current
  implementation of scoping has wrong semantics for nested vendored projects: a
  public library in the inner vendored project escapes its scope and is globally
  visible. This loophole caused problems for users, and we are going to remove
  it. This will be a breaking change but nested vendored projects are not very
  common, so this change will only affect a small number of users and in a
  positive way.

* **Better support for warnings.** Currently, if Dune executes a build command
  that reports a warning but doesn't fail, that warning will only be shown to
  the user on the first build. Indeed, since the command succeeded, there is no
  need to rerun it again in subsequent builds unless its inputs change, and so
  the warning may go unnoticed and unfixed. This is why Dune turns warnings into
  errors by default, which can be annoying. Dune users (and we too) often
  complain about this, so we are working on better support for warnings.

## What we plan to remove

We plan to remove the features listed below. Please let us know if you will be
affected and will need some help with the transition to Dune 3.

* **Support for OPAM v1.** We believe that it's not used any more, so we'd like
  to remove the associated code.

* **The external-lib-deps subcommand.** This subcommand prints out an
  approximate set of external libraries that are required for building given
  targets, without running the build. While this feature is useful, over time
  the quality of approximation has degraded and the cost of maintenance has
  increased.

* **Automatic creation/editing of dune-project files.** If there is no
  `dune-project` file, Dune interprets the `dune` file using the latest version
  of the Dune language, which changes over time. It is therefore a good practice
  to create a `dune-project` file to freeze the semantics of the `dune` file to a specific version of the language. Dune used to provide some support for creating and updating `dune-project` files automatically but in practice this feature caused a fair amount of confusion for users, so we are removing it.

* **Calling ocamlfind at runtime.** When running Dune outside of an OPAM
  environment, Dune invokes `ocamlfind` if it is present to figure out where to
  look for installed libraries. This is bad for reproducibility and doesn't feel
  useful anymore, so we plan to stop doing that. Dune will however continue to
  use the `OCAMLPATH` variable, as well as the search paths hard-coded at build
  time by the optional `./configure` script.

## Feedback

This plan is not set in stone. If you don't like it, please let us know and
we'll see how we can improve it.

Note that the Dune team is currently working on a few other features. They are
not going to be synchronised with the Dune 3 release, which is why we didn't
mention them above. If you are waiting for them, don't worry: they are still
coming but not necessarily in Dune 3. And don't hesitate to remind us about your
favourite feature requests &mdash; this helps us to set priorities.
